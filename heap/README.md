# CSE Project 3: Heaps

**Learning Goals**
- Integrate multiple ADTs and data structures to solve a problem with complex requirements.
- Plan the implementation of a data structure and its invariants.

## Programming
**ExtrinsicMinPQ API**

The main task for this assignment will be to develop an array-based implementation of the ExtrinsicMinPQ interface. The priority for each item will be extrinsic to the objectâ€”that is, rather than relying on some sort of comparison function to decide which item has less priority than another, we manually assign priorities by passing in numbers along with the items.
